Traceur's goal is to inform the design\nof new JavaScript features which are only valuable if they allow you to write\nbetter code. Traceur allows you to try out new and proposed\n[language features](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures)\ntoday, helping you say what you mean in your code while informing the standards process.\n\nJavaScript's evolution needs your input.\n[Try](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/GettingStarted) out the\nnew language features.\n[Tell us](http://groups.google.com/group/traceur-compiler-discuss)\nhow they work for you and what's still causing you to use more boilerplate and\n\"design patterns\" than you prefer.\n\n## What now? What can Traceur do for me?\n\nRead the\n[Getting Started](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/GettingStarted)\npage to get up and running. You can use some language features right now and\neven try it out in your browser [here](http://traceur-compiler.googlecode.com/git/demo/repl.html).\nJust type in some code and see what Traceur produces. For an idea of what is\navailable and what we have in the pipeline, see the\n[Language Features](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures)\npage.\n\nThe JSConf 2011 presentation of Traceur describes the goals of the project and\nwhat it can do today. Some documentation is on the wiki on this site.\nExtra demos are in the source repository.\n\nQuestions, suggestions, and comments can be directed to the\n[discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/traceur-compiler-discuss).\n",
