GENERAL INFORMATION ON OTHER GRAPHIC SOFTWARE PROGRAMS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Files and designs elements were created to be as smooth and clean 
cut as possible. Note that all graphics that have text were transformed as 
curves and not as text. This should also be considered when importing or 
converting the text design (it is suggested that you use your own text font 
of your graphic software).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL INFORMATION ON © COLOR VEHICLE TEMPLATE LIBRARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is vital information on the new library of ©COLOR  VEHICLE  TEMPLATES.
  
Always check the measurements of the vehicle.  Before cutting or printing 
any final artwork measure doors, windows and body side to verify graphic max. 
size. 

After importing the template (as per above instruction) UNGROUP the 
template to change the different elements of the layout, or to color the 
vehicle by selecting only the body of the vehicle. You may need to also 
color the doors, some programs do not support none-filled items (see image below). 

To re-size or re-scale the templates to 1/20 scale, you may have to do one of 
these attempts: RESIZE or SCALE the template to 2000% from the original imported 
size.  Gerber users:  RESIZE once by 1000%, then RESIZE again by 200%. 
To confirm the right scale always verify, as a guide, the wheel well measurement 
on the template and compare. When finished, you may GROUP the whole template 
so that the elements do not move by mistake when working on the template.
